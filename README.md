Python 3.x
speech_recognition library
pyttsx3 library
wikipedia library
Internet connection for web searches and Wikipedia information

Functions
speak(text)
Uses pyttsx3 to convert text to speech.

listen()
Listens for voice input using speech_recognition and returns the recognized text.

open_application(app_name)
Opens the specified application using the subprocess module.

perform_action(command)
Performs actions based on the voice command. The supported actions include opening applications, searching the web, providing information from Wikipedia, and telling the current time.

Error Handling
The script handles unknown value errors and request errors from the speech recognition service.
If an application cannot be opened, an error message is printed.
Notes
Make sure your microphone is set up correctly and has the necessary permissions for the script to listen to your voice.
The subprocess.Popen method used for opening applications works on Windows. For other operating systems, you might need to modify the method accordingly.
Troubleshooting
If the assistant doesn't respond, ensure your microphone is working and the necessary libraries are installed.
Check your internet connection if the script fails to search the web or fetch Wikipedia summaries.
